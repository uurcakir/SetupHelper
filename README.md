I developed this project based on my own needs.

Every time I set up a new computer, I spent too much time installing various applications.
To address this, I created a program that identifies the most commonly used applications by myself and other computer users and allows these applications to be downloaded directly from their original developers/publishers.
I included a speed test using the SpeedTest-Cli module and made it more colorful with the Colorama module.

All download links are from the official websites of the applications' developers/publishers.
